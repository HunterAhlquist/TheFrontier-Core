Minecraft server plugin

This is a Spigot/Bukkit supported plugin that I made for a friend's Minecraft server.

It doesn't do anything that would be appealing to a general audience of server admins, but it’s a plugin made to make my friend’s server unique. 
Here is the feature-list: 

* Mobs have a low chance to drop a spawner egg of its respective kind.

* Custom spawner recipes:
